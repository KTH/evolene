# Evolene CI ![Continous Integration](https://github.com/KTH/evolene/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

**Evolene CI runs a sequence of steps that build, test and in the end stores a Docker or NPM package in a registry. It is our way of standardising the build process, so that developers never have to learn anything about our continuous integration systems üòÉ or having to care where built artefacts are stored, or what processes to follow. Every user of Evolene run the same steps and when we add new features, everyone gets them without having to do anything üçæ**

The main principle for Evolene is  everything that a developer runs on her laptop is run the same way in the CI environment. No need for setting up a build or integration test environment on an external service. The idea is that a developer does a `git push` when it works locally, and Evolene handles the rest.

Evolene uses Convention Over Configuration. That means that Evolene is configured by following standard naming convensions rather then per project configuration. The Slack integration helps the developers if any configuration is missing or test breaks.

## Use Evolene CI with Github Actions

Add the **Github Action yaml content below** to a the Github Action workflow `.github/workflows/main.yml`. That is it üéâ! 

If you have üîë secret environment variables somewhere in your process (like tests) add them in `/ Settings / Secrets / Repository secrets / EVOLENE_TEST_SECRETS` as _key=value_ pairs. Read [more about secrets in Evolene here](https://github.com/KTH/evolene/blob/master/README-COMMON.md#secret-envs-needed-for-integration-tests-and-other-stuff), there are more customizing you can do:
